ðŸ“Œ API Documentation

### I have done the project at first using the xampp server because while running docker, my system takes more execution time to run the APIs.
### But after running the APIs I installed docker and all the configurations are done and all functionalities are working fine.

### If any issues are facing like 403 forbidden or 504 gateway time out while running docker in your system, make sure your ngnix.conf file is pointing to the public folder of the project folder.

### I have chosen 3 Data Sources among the sources you have provided.It is listed below:
    # The Guardian
    # New York Times
    # NewsAPI.org

###  I have implemented Laravel scheduled commands to regularly fetch and update articles from the chosen news APIs

    #After running the artisan command please run the queue starting commands.

       php artisan queue:restart # Run if needed to restart the queue.
       php artisan queue:work

### After running this please hit the API below to  fetch and store articles in the local database.
